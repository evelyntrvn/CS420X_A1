# CS420X Assignment 1

For this project I wanted to experiment with using the audio and having the visuals react to music. Because the music is more upbeat and electronic, I wanted to have more flashy and vibrant colors. Using the rotate function also allowed me to change up the colors based on the time. I also wanted to have different colors for different sections of the piece so I experimented with the mouse movement to distinguish the different color palettes. I also wanted to experiment with circles in terms of its color, position, and size. I like how the 2 different circles contrast with one another because it brings out the harsh attacks in the music. When sections of the music got more delicate, I would move the mouse to the softer, rotating colors to try and lessen the flashiness. I added in the line that moves based on the music because there was still a lot of space and I wanted to understand some of the code in the textbook as well. I think it also adds a more glitch-y effect which plays into the electronic feel.
